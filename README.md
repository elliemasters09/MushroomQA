# MushroomQA
	
##Why are we doing this?
This is my final assessment for the QA boot camp to show case the new skills I've learnt on the course. I created a a Spring Boot application with a relational database.
	
##What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
I found the project quite challenging as learnt a lot during project week that I had not yet mastered during the course. I utilised many of the skills I had learnt.
	
##Possible improvements of future revisions of the project:
Many improvements can be made to the project which I will continue to work on for future versions including adding new features like custom queries/exceptions and increasing test coverage.
